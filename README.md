# Landing Page Project

## DOM Manipulation

The starter project from Udacity had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I have converted it from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Features

- Dynamically built navigation
- Smooth scroll
- Form validation
- Responsive design

## Get Started

Open `index.html` in your browser.
